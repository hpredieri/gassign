Needs improvement:
-the only issue I had was the long section of summaries. All of these tests are obviously necessary to perform the most accurate modeling but strictly from a presentation perspective, it was very difficult to stay focused and read through all of them. I would say show a few and give more of a summary description of your findings. Unfortunately from the level of average business guy I am not in a position to give you technical advice.
