Good Aspects:
-code is efficient, easy to follow
-good comments to transition through i/o
-formatting, column engineering is efficient/smart
-good visuals, could use more
-the decision tree model was explained well


Needs improvement:
understanding the dataset, columns. easy to just pull from first project


I unfortuately didn't make it to the presentation which would have helped as most of my confusion was on the dataset. Even just having a link to the first project would have probably answered all of my questions. There was an efficient, effective flow to the presentation, making the most of each input/output and explaining the significance with comments in between. Good visualizations, I think a few more basic graphs might have helped in the beginning (probably just cut and paste from the first project). Decision tree works well, I would be interested what other classifiers might output.
