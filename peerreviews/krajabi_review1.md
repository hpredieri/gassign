Kiyan's project worked very well as he set three specific questions as his objectives and methodically worked through each one to answer it and review it.

I like how he set all of his information before going into the dataset. However it's much more conducive for me to stop and read markdown cells as comments in the code do not standout. Also it might be helpful to talk more about the dataset/topic of the project when you talk about the objectives. 
He did articulate his oral presentation very well so many of these things were not necessary at the time.

I think it would make it easier if he used percentages of the total population(via gender/race) rather than working with total counts. It was difficult to get a good grasp of the some of the graphs as their scales hid some of the key differences he had eluded to during his presentation.

There was a good narrative in between inputs/outputs that helps understand the thought process, as well as pointing out key findings from visualizations and graphs. 

I think the best step forward would be to refine some of your objectives so that you could find some more obscure relationships in the data. I think finding another dataset to cross-reference may be your best bet to accomplish that. Unfortunately I am a terrible biology student and have no idea what that might entail!
