Having chosen this presentation to present for our group it was obviously extremely thorough and well-documented.

The introduction is very effective as it frames what the presentation is, where the data is from and what process he will use to gain knowledge or shed light on his concise, well-defined goal. Showing the logic behind why they collect the data in the first place I thought was very intriguing as he might be able to compare and contrast his objectives versus those of the department of finance.

Going in to presenting his data set, James did a good job using comments, header cells and markdown cells to show how he cleaned up the dataframe to get it into a serviceable setting. After cutting off excess features and text, he used a narrative style inbetween sections where he poses questions and gives an understanding as to his thought process moving from one input/output to the next which makes the presentation a lot more appealing and gives perspective.

Although James did establish at the very beginning of the presentation that this was a data visualization, going from one plot to the next I was much more likely to keep scrolling and forget what was the significance of the previous graph. It might be useful to have a couple longer markdown cells for markdown cells to break the work into clearer sections.

All of the visualizations were articulated well and contributed to answering key questions. The graphs by neighborhood were very interesting, and it was a very good idea to change the scale on the net operating income graph (the title of that graph didn't match the string under ax.set_title?). Similarly the ols regressions and their summaries definitely achieved their goals and effectively tied this portion of the project together.

The final summary works well because it ties the findings to more questions to be asked for further examination of the dataset. Excited to see this cross-referenced with another city dataset!
