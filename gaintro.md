1. Houston Predieri
2. Starting at JP Morgan in an entry level position, have been studying the building blocks of data science for the last 2.5-3 months
3. With a degree in political science I am interested in working with data around tax reform, the education system and campaign finance. I have found that the Sunlight Foundation has a lot of good data to work with in this sector. I am also very interested in political philosophy and am trying to learn anything I can about neuroscience as I find both of these fields fascinating. 
4. I signed up for this class before I found employment in efforts to upgrade my skill set and gain employment. 
I am interested in developing some ideas I have into working projects and find a way to get paid to practice and/or propound philosophy.
